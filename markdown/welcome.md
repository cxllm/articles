## Welcome

This is an introduction to my blog, which you are currently viewing. Here you can find out info about how it works and what the purpose of it is.

Before making this, I had seen other people making their own blogs, and I wanted one of my own, but I didn't want the limitations of Medium or dev.to, so I decided to make my own. This site has been remade a few times, and there will often be big gaps between me posting different articles here as I don't have a lot of content to post

### How It Works

This site uses a Python backend with HTML, CSS & JS on the frontend. To write the articles, I use markdown, which is then converted to HTML using the Python module [markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/). I generate a css file for code block formatting using a module called [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) and I use a customised version of the Material theme on this. I use Flask and Jinja to template this code to insert the formatted HTML and information about the article. You can find the source code for this project [here](https://github.com/cxllm/articles)
